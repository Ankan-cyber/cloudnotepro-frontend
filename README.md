# CloudNotePro-frontend

CloudNotePro is a modern web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that allows users to take and save notes in the cloud. The app is designed for individuals and teams who want a simple and easy-to-use solution for keeping track of their notes and ideas.

The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to create new notes, edit existing notes, and organize their notes into folders. Notes can be formatted using rich text editor and can include images and links.

The app also offers a powerful search function that allows users to quickly find specific notes by keyword, tag, or folder. Additionally, notes can be shared with other users and collaborate on them in real-time.

The app uses MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the back-end web framework and Node.js as the runtime environment. React is used as the front-end framework and all the data is stored on the cloud, so the user can access it from anywhere at any time.

Overall, CloudNotePro is the perfect solution for anyone looking for a reliable and user-friendly note-taking app that saves notes in the cloud.
